Coins
=====

New coins are coming out all the time, and I would like to support as many as
possible, but there are so many little differences, and testing is required
and all that jazz. So here are a few of the upcoming candidates, and what
features make them special that I must still investigate to support them.

1. Namecoin - highest on my list (AuxPoW)
2. Novacoin (PoS)
3. Mooncoin (website is down?)
4. Kittehcoin (soon AuxPoW)

Other coins I know of, that would be nice, but I really know very little about,
such as whether they are even based on bitcoind, which is really all pycoind
can support at this time.

Darkcoin
Leafcoin
Tacocoin (I can't even find a working block explorer)
Peercoin
Flappycoin
Vericoin (PoS)
Bitcoin Dark (is it just a fancy wallet something-something?)

Terms
-----

AuxPoW - Auxillary Proof-of-Work
    Basically allows one coin to benefit from the success of another coin
    and strengthen its own network.

    This is high on my priority list, as I want to support Namecoin

PoS - Proof-of-Stake
    Some sort of way to ensure those with the most to lose are the ones with
    the most power. I know very little about the technical side at this point.

    I don't know how this affects the underlying protocol yet...

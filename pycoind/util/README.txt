pyscrypt
--------

Description: Pure-Python implementation of Scrypt PBKDF and scrypt file
             format library.

python-ecdsa
------------

Description: This is an easy-to-use implementation of ECDSA cryptography
             (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), implemented purely
             in Python, released under the MIT license. With this library,
             you can quickly create keypairs (signing key and verifying key),
             sign messages, and verify the signatures. The keys and signatures
             are very short, making them easy to handle and incorporate into
             other protocols.

Notes: This package is used to verify alert messages, signing/verifying
       transactions, generating keys for addresses, et cetera.
